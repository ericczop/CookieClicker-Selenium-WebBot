# CookieClicker
This Python script automates a cookie-clicking game using Selenium WebDriver. It launches Chrome, accesses the game at a specific URL, and continuously clicks a cookie element. Every five seconds, the script checks for upgradable items in the game store, comparing their costs with the current cookie count. It parses item prices, compiles a list of affordable upgrades, and purchases the most expensive available upgrade. After running for five minutes, the script outputs the cookies-per-second rate and terminates. The script demonstrates automated interaction with web elements, dynamic content processing, and decision-making based on real-time data within a web application.
